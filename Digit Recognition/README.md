## About MNIST dataset:
MNIST [(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database)] is probably one of the most popular datasets among machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale training images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9 and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes.
