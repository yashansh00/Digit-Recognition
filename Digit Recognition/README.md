# Deep-Learning-MNIST---Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

An implementation of multilayer neural network using keras with an Accuracy: mean=98.960 std=0.097, n=5 using 5-crossfold Validation and using the built-in evaluation of 99.13

## About MNIST dataset:
MNIST [(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database)](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyann.lecun.com%2Fexdb%2Fmnist%2F) is probably one of the most popular datasets among machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 small square 28×28 pixel grayscale training images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9 and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes.

## Steps:

1. Import the libraries and load the dataset: Importing the necessary libraries, packages and MNIST dataset
2. Preprocess the data
3. Create the model
4. Train and Evaluate the Model
5. Saving the model
6. Make Predictions
